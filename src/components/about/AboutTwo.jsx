                    Iâ€™m a problem-solver by heart and passionate about harnessing technology for
                     positive global impact. I studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto,
                      which provided me with a solid foundation of the theoretical basis and practical
                       applications of computation and software. I have extensive experience in software
                        engineering and have also worked in 
                        areas such as artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. 
                        My fascination for logical reasoning, mathematics and creative thinking fuels
                         my enthusiasm for building software to transform our lives. Other things I 
                         love include working out, listening to music and spending time with friends
                          and family!
