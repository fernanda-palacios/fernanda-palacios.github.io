    This project was part of CSC318 Design of Interactive 
    Computational Media and its goal was to enhance the social fabric 
    across the student community.  We designed a mobile app for students to 
    find and join groups for studying, socializing or extracurricular activities. 
    Throughout the design process, we conducted user research, developed and tested 
    various prototypes and developed a high-fidelity prototype using Framer.
